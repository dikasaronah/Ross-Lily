# eye color chart what color eyes will my baby have - pin on genetics | eye color allele chart
**eye color chart what color eyes will my baby have - pin on genetics | eye color allele chart**. Websep 8, 2023 · this simplistic theory tells us that if a baby’s eye color is blue then they have two blue alleles, one inherited from each parent. Brown is the most frequent eye color worldwide. As a dominant trait, brown eyes can come from six different genetic combinations. This square diagram lets you test different genetic combinations based on the parents’ eye colors — it also comes in handy when trying … To find any recessive traits, it&#039;s helpful to know the grandparents&#039; eye colors.
Websep 8, 2023 · this simplistic theory tells us that if a baby’s eye color is blue then they have two blue alleles, one inherited from each parent. Most of the genes associated with eye color are involved in the production, transport, or storage of a pigment called melanin. But do these charts work? To find any recessive traits, it&#039;s helpful to know the grandparents&#039; eye colors. Webthe range in eye color, from blue to hazel to brown (see figure one), depends on the level of melanin pigment stored in the melanosome “packets” in the melanocytes of the iris.
